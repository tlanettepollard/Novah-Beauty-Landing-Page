# Novah-Beauty-Landing-Page

## Landing page for Novah Beauty Salon
### Starting The Project
I've been working on my new design, _Novah Beauty Salon_, for couple of months. I started with by building a wireframe using the Relume Library Figma Kit. I was able to get the general design for the page. 
Then based on my inspiration from a picture, I created the color scheme. Finally, I designed the desktop, tablet, and mobile page versions of my landing page. After a few design changes, I have coded the final version of Novah Beauty Salon landing page.
